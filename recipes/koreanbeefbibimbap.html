        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Korean Beef Bibimbap is a dish that is healthy and full of flavor. The dish is made up of mostly vegetables with rice and beef being a nice addition. The spices, sriracha, white wine vinegar and sesame seed oil combine to provide a beautiful coordinate pallet of both spicy, and sweet.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Zucchini</li>
            <li>2-3 scallions</li>
            <li>1 thumb ginger</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Jasmine Rice</li>
            <li>4 ounce Button Mushroom</li>
            <li>6 ounce carrots</li>
            <li>2 clove garlic</li>
            <li>10 ounce ground beef</li>
            <li>5 teaspoon White Wine Vinegar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon Sriracha</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Sesame Oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1.5 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>4 teaspoon Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and dry all produce. Bring 1¼ cups water to a boil in a small pot. Halve zucchini lengthwise; slice into thin half-moons. Trim and thinly slice mushrooms and scallions, keeping scallion greens and whites separate. Peel carrot; using a peeler, shave lengthwise into ribbons. Peel and mince ginger. Mince garlic.</li>
            <li>Once water is boiling, add rice and a pinch of salt to pot. Cover, lower heat, and reduce to a gentle simmer. Cook until tender, 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Toss scallion whites with vinegar and a pinch of salt in a small bowl. Set aside to marinate. In another small bowl, stir together sesame oil, 1½ TBSP sugar, up to half the sriracha, and 1½ TBSP soy sauce (we will use the rest of the sriracha and soy sauce later).</li>
            <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat (use a nonstick pan if you have one). Add carrot; season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing, until tender but still crisp, 3-4 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside. Add another drizzle of oil to pan and repeat with zucchini; remove from pan once cooked. Add mushrooms and another drizzle of oil to pan and cook until tender, 3-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat another drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add beef, breaking up meat into pieces. Cook, tossing occasionally, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Increase heat to high and continue cooking until browned and crisp, about 3 minutes. Pour in remaining soy sauce and cook, tossing, until mostly evaporated, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Divide rice between bowls. Arrange beef, zucchini, carrot, mushrooms, and scallion whites on top. Drizzle with sauce and remaining sriracha (to taste). Sprinkle with scallion greens and serve.</li>
        </ol>
